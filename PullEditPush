To pull, edit, and then push back to GitHub from the terminal, you'll need to use Git commands. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites
1. **Git installed**: Make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can check by running `git --version` in the terminal.
2. **GitHub repository**: You need to have a GitHub repository URL.
3. **SSH keys or GitHub credentials**: Ensure you have set up SSH keys or have your GitHub credentials ready for authentication.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. For example:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd repo
   ```

3. **Create a new branch (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

4. **Edit the files**:
   Use your preferred text editor to make changes to the files. For example:
   ```bash
   nano file.txt
   ```
   Save and exit the editor.

5. **Add the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all the changes. If you want to add specific files, replace `.` with the file names.

6. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
   Replace `"Your commit message"` with a meaningful message describing the changes.

7. **Push the changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin new-branch-name
   ```
   If you didn't create a new branch, just push to the current branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git

# Navigate into the repository
cd repo

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-update

# Edit a file
nano file.txt

# Stage the changes
git add file.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Updated file.txt with new features"

# Push the changes to the new branch
git push origin feature-update
```

### Tips

- **Check status**: Use `git status` to see the status of your working directory and staging area.
- **View changes**: Use `git diff` to view changes that have been made but not staged.
- **List branches**: Use `git branch` to list all branches and `git branch -a` to list all branches, including remote-tracking branches.
- **Switch branches**: Use `git checkout branch-name` to switch to another branch.
